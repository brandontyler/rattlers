## Session Notes

_Add notes, blockers, or decisions here:_

- **Jan 15, 2026:** Created comprehensive integration plan for migrating from Leaflet to mapcn (MapLibre GL + shadcn/ui). Plan includes 4-phase migration strategy (POC → Feature Parity → Enhancements → Deployment), component mapping, bundle size analysis, and risk mitigation. Key benefits: WebGL performance, theme support, modern DX, smaller bundle (-15KB). See docs/MAPCN_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md for full details.
- **Jan 2, 2026 (PM):** Comprehensive security audit using first principles thinking. Key fixes: (1) Removed userId exposure from public API responses (leaderboards, check-ins, suggestions) - user IDs are internal identifiers that shouldn't be exposed. (2) Removed email addresses from API responses to protect PII. (3) Fixed username fallback to use "Anonymous" instead of email address. (4) Removed PII logging (userId, details) from console.log statements. (5) Added Zod validation schema for check-in submissions with proper input validation. (6) Added photoKey path validation with regex to prevent path traversal attacks. (7) Fixed suggestions status validation logic error that silently returned data for invalid statuses. Security regression tests added for all fixes. All 360 tests pass.
- **Jan 2, 2026:** Applied first principles thinking to improve codebase architecture. Key changes: (1) Unified 6 nearly-identical counter functions (incrementLikeCount, decrementLikeCount, incrementSaveCount, etc.) into a single generic `adjustCounter` function - DRY principle, 60% less code for counter operations. (2) Optimized trending locations query - changed from fetching ALL locations then filtering to using new `getLocationsByIds` batch operation that fetches only the ~10 locations with recent check-ins. This is O(limit) instead of O(total_locations). (3) Removed dead code - deleted unused `getCurrentUser` API method that called non-existent `/users/me` endpoint. (4) Removed scan fallback anti-pattern in feedback.ts - the old code silently fell back to expensive table scans which hid infrastructure issues. Now uses GSI directly and fails fast if misconfigured. All 358 tests pass.
- **Jan 1, 2026 (PM):** Added Trending This Week feature showing the most active locations based on recent check-ins. Uses first principles thinking: Christmas light viewing is time-sensitive and social - users want to know what's popular RIGHT NOW. Algorithm uses weighted check-in statuses (amazing=3, on=2, changed=1, off=0.5) with exponential decay (~3.5 day half-life). Home page shows top 8 trending locations with rank badges. Map markers for trending locations show flame badge. New endpoint: GET /locations/trending with configurable limit/days params. New components: TrendingSection, hot marker icons.
- **Jan 1, 2026:** Added Live Status Check-ins feature. Users can now report the current status of displays (Lights ON, Lights OFF, Amazing Tonight, Changed/Gone) with optional notes. Check-in status is displayed on location detail pages and map popups. Uses first principles thinking: Christmas displays are ephemeral - they change night-to-night, and users want real-time confidence before driving to a location. New components: CheckInModal, CheckInStatus. New table: christmas-lights-checkins. New endpoints: POST/GET /locations/{id}/checkins.
- **Dec 29, 2025 (Late PM2):** Fixed address autocomplete returning no results for street addresses like "424 Headlee St". Root cause: AWS Location Service V2 docs specify BiasPosition and Filter.BoundingBox are mutually exclusive. Using both caused empty results. Fix: removed BoundingBox from Filter, keeping only IncludeCountries. BiasPosition continues to prefer North Texas results, and post-query isInNorthTexas() filter ensures geographic restrictions. Added regression test verifying Filter has no BoundingBox.
- **Dec 29, 2025 (Late PM):** Enhanced photo analysis with Amazon Nova Pro (AWS-native model for showcase). Changed from Claude 3.5 Sonnet to Amazon Nova Pro for better cost-performance. Implemented vision AI best practices: system prompt with role assignment (reduces hallucinations), structured JSON output with 30+ decoration categories, confidence scores, quality ratings, and style tags. Added comprehensive decoration inventory including light types (string, icicle, net, projection, laser, animated), yard decorations (inflatables, blow molds, nativity, snowman, Santa, reindeer), and special features (music sync, themed displays, mega trees). Supports jpeg/png/gif/webp (browsers auto-convert iPhone HEIC on upload).
- **Dec 29, 2025 (PM2):** Fixed street address suggestions not appearing (e.g., "424 headlee st" returned no results). Root cause: was using AWS Location Service V2 `SuggestCommand` which is designed for broader query predictions and POIs. Fix: switched to `AutocompleteCommand` which is specifically designed for completing street addresses. The Suggest API was returning Query-type results (for refinements) instead of Place-type results for partial street addresses. Added regression tests for street address queries.
- **Dec 29, 2025 (PM):** Fixed address autocomplete bug - suggestions with null coordinates from AWS Location Service V2 caused frontend crashes when calling `.toFixed()` on null lat/lng values in AddressAutocomplete.tsx. Fix: filter out suggestions without valid coordinates in backend since they're not useful for geocoding anyway. Added regression tests.
- **Dec 29, 2025 (AM):** Fixed like spam bug - users could click like/unlike rapidly and increment the counter multiple times. Root cause was using random UUIDs for feedback IDs which bypassed the atomic write protection. Fix: use deterministic feedback IDs based on userId + locationId + type so duplicate attempts fail the conditional write. Added tests for race condition handling.
- **Dec 28, 2025:** Updated all documentation to reflect TypeScript backend migration. AWS Location Service V2 now used for address autocomplete. Added Apple Maps and Waze navigation integration. CI/CD pipeline now runs tests before deployment.
- **Dec 27, 2025:** Migrated backend from Python to TypeScript for improved type safety and LLM compatibility. Removed Python backend code. CDK infrastructure updated to use TypeScript Lambda functions.
- **Dec 26, 2025:** Upgraded address suggestions to use AWS Location Service V2 Places API (Suggest + GetPlace). Removed Nominatim/OpenStreetMap dependency.
- **Dec 25, 2025:** Added Apple Maps and Waze navigation integration alongside Google Maps. Users can choose preferred navigation app. Multi-stop routes supported for Google Maps; stop-by-stop navigation for Apple Maps and Waze.
- **Dec 14, 2025:** Added comprehensive test suite for frontend and backend. CI pipeline now runs tests before deployment. Tests must pass for code to be deployed.
- **Dec 12, 2025:** Added duplicate location detection - warns users before submission if location already exists. Added photo submission for existing locations - users can add photos to locations that don't have any via AddPhotoModal. New endpoints: POST /locations/check-duplicate, GET /locations/{id}/pending-photo.
- **Dec 11, 2025:** Added Community Routes feature - users can save routes from route planner, browse public routes, like/save routes, view on profile. New leaderboard tab for top routes and route creators. Route creator badges: Route Scout (1), Trail Blazer (3), Route Master (5), Legend (10+).
- **Dec 10, 2025 (Late PM):** Rewrote import script to extract coordinates from Google Maps URLs. Entries without coords go to suggestions table for admin review. Added `source` field to track data origin. Admin page now shows Google Maps link for suggestions.
- **Dec 10, 2025 (PM):** Added Leaderboards with tabs (Contributors + Most Loved locations). Added "Submitted by [avatar] username" attribution on location popups and detail pages. New endpoint: GET /leaderboard/locations.
- **Dec 10, 2025:** Added AI-generated Christmas-themed usernames using Bedrock Claude (e.g., "JollyReindeerRider", "TwinklingStarCollector"). Users can edit their username on the profile page.
- **Dec 9, 2025:** Added admin edit functionality for locations and suggestions - can now edit descriptions, AI descriptions, categories, themes, and display quality before approval. Fixed route panel to stay minimized when adding stops.
- **Dec 9, 2025:** Enhanced AI photo analysis - now triggers on suggestion submit (not just photo upload), ensuring all photos get analyzed regardless of upload order.
- **Dec 8, 2025 (PM):** Fixed mobile popup closing issue - disabled autoPan, added manual pan after popup opens
- **Dec 8, 2025:** Added contributor badges system (First Light, Scout, Enthusiast, Expert) with progress tracking on profile page
- **Dec 7, 2025:** Fixed map popups to show full LocationPopup component with photos, descriptions, tags, and action buttons instead of just address
- **Dec 6, 2025 (PM):** User Profiles MVP complete! Added profile page with email, join date, activity stats (total/approved/pending/rejected), submission history with expandable cards, photo thumbnails, rejection reasons, and status badges
- **Dec 6, 2025 (AM):** Photo features complete! Added full photo gallery with carousel + lightbox, automatic compression (20MB→2MB), enhanced iPhone HEIC support
- **Dec 5, 2025 (PM):** Enhanced PDF with ReportLab best practices - custom page template with corner ornaments, page numbers, alternating row colors, gradient-style stats box
- **Dec 5, 2025 (AM):** Documentation consolidated. Reverted WeasyPrint (requires native libs not in Lambda). Next priority: wire up feedback UI
- **Dec 4, 2025:** Route planner + PDF generation complete with QR codes
