    "CONTEXT: Read docs/PROJECT.md first - it's the single source of truth for project status, roadmap, and session notes",
    "CONTEXT: docs/API.md has endpoint specs, docs/ARCHITECTURE.md has system design",
    "CONTEXT: README.md is public-facing only - keep it slim, point to docs/ for details",
    "CRITICAL: NEVER commit or push directly to main branch - NO EXCEPTIONS",
    "ALWAYS create a new feature branch before making ANY changes",
    "Branch naming: use descriptive names like 'fix/pdf-title-spacing' or 'feat/feedback-ui'",
    "Commit messages: be very descriptive - explain WHAT changed and WHY",
    "After committing, push the feature branch to origin",
    "Create a detailed PR to main with summary of all changes",
    "Wait for PR approval before any code reaches main",
    "After PR is merged, switch to main and pull latest before starting new work",
    "When features are completed, update docs/PROJECT.md status tables and session notes",
    "Keep README.md minimal - only update for major feature additions"
